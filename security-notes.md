# 🛡️ Solana Counter Security Testing Notes

## 🔐 Broken Authentication Test
**📅 Date:** March 4, 2025  
**🎯 Objective:** Assess the DApp's ability to detect and block unauthenticated or fake wallet addresses.

### 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Unregistered Address Test**
   - Generated random valid public keys using `Keypair.generate()`.
   - Ensured keys matched Solana’s base58 format (32-44 characters).
   - Tested on Devnet, resulting in the expected error: `Account does not exist on blockchain`.

2. **Registered Address Test**
   - Used a registered Phantom wallet (`FHCVCR71Hm1Yrw8JsiURNqCDEUm4pgkB8F4XFic6mwT9`) with 2 SOL on Devnet.
   - `isValidSolanaAddress` and `isAccountExists` checks returned ✅ **true**.
   - Successfully retrieved counter value `11` without any UI errors.

### 🔍 Findings
✅ The DApp correctly blocked unregistered addresses.  
⚠️ However, it accepted a registered address **without signature verification**, making it vulnerable to spoofing attacks.

### 🛠️ Recommendation
🔄 Implement **signature verification** from Phantom Wallet to ensure only authenticated users can interact.

## 🏗️ Security Misconfiguration Test
**📅 Date:** March 5, 2025  
**🎯 Objective:** Evaluate the DApp's response to incorrect network configurations.

### 🛠️ Methodology
1. **Initial Test**
   - Attempted connection using:
     - ✅ Mainnet (`https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com`)
     - ❌ Fake URL (`https://fake-solana-api.com`)
   - Wallet connection succeeded **without errors**, indicating a lack of network validation. ⚠️

2. **Validation Implementation**
   - Created `page-security-test.tsx` for isolated testing ([page-security-test.tsx](https://github.com/kuzuma/solana-counter/app/page-security-test.tsx)).
   - Added network validation in `connectWallet` to check if `connection.rpcEndpoint` matches `clusterApiUrl("devnet")`.
   - Retested with mainnet and fake URL.

### 🔍 Findings
✅ **Before Fix:** Connections were successful, posing a security risk.  
✅ **After Fix:** Both **mainnet and fake URL connections were blocked** with the message:  
   🚫 `Invalid network configuration. Must use Devnet.`

### 📜 Logs
#### 🔗 **Mainnet Test**
```
Connected to network: https://api.mainnet-beta.solana.com
Gagal menghubungkan wallet: Invalid network configuration. Must use Devnet.
```
#### ❌ **Fake URL Test**
```
Connected to network: https://fake-solana-api.com
Gagal menghubungkan wallet: Invalid network configuration. Must use Devnet.
```
### 🔄 Implication
🔒 **Prevents unintended network access and protects against data exposure.**

### 🛠️ Recommendation
- 🔄 Implement **signature verification** from Phantom Wallet to ensure only authenticated users can interact.

## 📝 General Notes
- 📍 All tests conducted **locally** (no deployment updates required).
- 🔬 Test page (`page-security-test.tsx`) remains **exclusive** to local development.
- 🔍 **Future Testing:** Explore additional **OWASP categories** (e.g., Sensitive Data Exposure).
